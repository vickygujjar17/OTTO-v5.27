"""
One-shot v5.28 -> v5.29 version bump for the OTTO EA tree.

Rewrites #property version "5.28" -> "5.29" in otto.mq5 and every .mqh
header. Historical FIX annotations naming an older release must survive
untouched, so any line containing 'FIX (' is skipped outright rather than
pattern-matched.

v5.29 note: the 'Pine Script Master Build Port (vX)' banner and the
'OTTO EA vX' startup banner are both matched explicitly, matching the v5.28
bump script, so no human-facing release string is left one version behind.

The README's 'Current base' line is bumped too -- it is the documented
release marker the build tree is checked against, and it lives outside the
compiled sources so no #property pattern would ever find it.

Reports every changed line so the diff can be eyeballed before commit.
